Robot Grasping Robustness Prediction

# Abstract
  With the rise of Industry 4.0 and advancement in Robotics most of the warehouses and other inventory management facilities use robots for the handling of their goods. These robots handle trillions of dollars worth of goods ona daily basis. Handling fragile goods among these is a major problem to the industry as robots might sometimes lose their grips during motion and can cause damages and other related expenses.
  The aim of this project is to find a solution to this.
  
# Dataset
  The dataset used here has been sourced from Kaggle. The observations recorded in the dataset have been obtained througha  software simulation with a ball as the object.

# Program
  The proposed apporach uses a Deep Learning Model and tries to predict the Robustness Factor based on the inputs. The Robustness Factor can be defined as the variation of the distance between the plam and the ball during the shaking motion.
